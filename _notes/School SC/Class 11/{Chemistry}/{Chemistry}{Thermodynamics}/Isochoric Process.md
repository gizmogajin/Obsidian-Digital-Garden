# Isochoric

- Volume Constant
- $\Delta$V = 0
- In a rigid Container
- ![[Zoom_t8ve1np1fC.png]]
-  W = - P$_{external}$$\Delta$V
	- W = 0
	- According to 1st law
		- $\Delta$U = q + w
		- w = 0 
		- $\Delta$U = q$_v$ - > Here , q = q$_v$ since heat at constant volume
			- Heat absorbed at constant volume is used to increase the $\Delta$U of the gas
- ***Heat at constant volume is a state function***
	- ***ie, normal q (heat)=path function while
	  q$_v$(heat at const volume)=state function***
- Work done = 0, so it is not possible to find out the work done.
