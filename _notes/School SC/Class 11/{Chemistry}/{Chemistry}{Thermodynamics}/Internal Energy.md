- $\Delta$U 
- Sum of all Energy is called Internal Energy.
- The absolute value of Internal energy cannot be determined, but we can calculate the change in internal energy.
	- $\Delta$U = PE + KE
- $\Delta$U is Temperature dependant
- **Heat** - The energy transfer due to temperature difference 'q'
