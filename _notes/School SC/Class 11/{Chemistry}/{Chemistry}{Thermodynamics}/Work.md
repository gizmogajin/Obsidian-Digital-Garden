- The energy against external pressure is called pressure
---
Work = F x dx

	- V$_1$ = Change in Volume
	- V$_2$ = Change in Volume
	- x = Change in length
	- Work = Force x displacement

- **Units of Heat/Work**
	- 1 Cal = 4.18 J = 4.2 J
	- 1 L atm = 101.3 J = 24.2 Cal = 101.3 * 10$^7$ erg 
		-  = 100 J = 24 Cal = 10$^9$ erg
- **Questions**
	- When 1 mol gas expands from 1 L to 5 L against constant atmospheric pressure.
		- = 1 atm
		- $\Delta$V = V$_2$ - V$_1$ = 5L - 1L = 4L
		- Work done by the system = -P $\Delta$V
			- -1 * 4
			- = - 4 L atm
			- = - 400 J
