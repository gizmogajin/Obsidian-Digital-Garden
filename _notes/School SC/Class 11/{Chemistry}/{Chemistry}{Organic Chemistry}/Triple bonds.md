- When two atoms share three pairs of valence electrons (six valence electrons), the established bonds are called [[Triple bonds|triple bonds]].
- Triple bonds are the **strongest** and the **most reactive** [[Covalent Bonds|covalent bonds]].
- When compared with [[Single Bonds|single]] and [[Double bonds|double bonds]], triple bonds have the **lowest bond length** due to the **higher pulling force** between two atoms. A triple bond is denoted by three parallel dashes between two atoms.
- It has 1 [[Sigma Bonds|sigma bond]] and 2 [[Pi Bonds|pi bonds]]
- Example : C≡C. Some examples of compounds with triple bonds include nitrogen gas (N≡N), cyanide ion (C≡N), acetylene (CH≡CH) and carbon monoxide (C≡O).
