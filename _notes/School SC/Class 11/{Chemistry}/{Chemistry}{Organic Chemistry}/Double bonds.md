- Compounds with double bonds are highly reactive than [[Single Bonds|single bonded]] compounds but less reactive than compounds with [[Triple bonds]].
- Double bonds are denoted by two parallel dashes
- It has 1 [[Sigma Bonds|sigma bond]] and 1 [[Pi Bonds|pi bond]]
- Example : C=C. Some examples of compounds with double bonds include alkenes such as ethylene, propene, carbonyl compounds (C=O), azo compounds (N=N), imines (C=N), and sulfoxides (S=O).
