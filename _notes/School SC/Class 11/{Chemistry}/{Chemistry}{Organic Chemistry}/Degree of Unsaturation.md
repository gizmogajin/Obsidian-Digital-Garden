- Also called
	- [[Degree of Unsaturation]] DU
	- [[Degree of Unsaturation|Index of Hydrogen deficiency]] IHD
	- [[Degree of Unsaturation|Unsaturation Index]] UI
	- [[Degree of Unsaturation|Double Bond Equivalent]] DBE
- Number of H$_{2}$ molecules which are required to convert a [[Molecule|molecule]](multiple) into an [[Open Chain Compound|open chain]] [[Saturated Compounds|saturated compound]] 
	- *All the [[Double bonds]] and [[Triple bonds]] should be broken and also the compound should have an open chain structure, ie, no rings should be present*
- Case **1**
	- Number of H$_{2}$ molecules which are required to convert a [[Molecule|molecule]](multiple) into a [[Saturated Compounds|saturated compound]] .
	- ![[Pasted image 20230101181700.png]]
		- [[Degree of Unsaturation|DU]] = 1 for first compound.
		- [[Degree of Unsaturation|DU]] = 2 for second compound.
- Case **2**
	- Number of [[Bonds]] that are cleaved/broken to convert the compound to an [[Open Chain Compound|open chain compound]].
	- ![[Pasted image 20230101182240.png]]
		- [[Degree of Unsaturation|DU]] = 1 for first compound.
		- [[Degree of Unsaturation|DU]] = 1 for the second compound.
- **Formula**
	- **1** If [[Molecular Formula]] is given$$DoU= (C + 1) - \ \dfrac{(H+X-N)}{2}$$
		- **OR** $$DoU= (C + 1) + \ \dfrac{(N-X-H)}{2}$$
		- C is the number of carbons
		- N is the number of nitrogens
		- X is the number of halogens (F, Cl, Br, I)
		- H is the number of hydrogens
		- **[[Charge]] has no significance in the formula**
	- **2**
		- DU = Degrees of Unsaturation = (number of pi bonds) + (number of rings)
