- A single bond is formed by sharing of one pair of valence electrons between two adjacent atoms.
- A single bond is the simplest form of a [[Covalent Bonds|covalent bond]], where each atom provides one valence electron.
- These valence electrons are located in the outermost shell of atoms. Here, the negatively charged shared electrons are being pulled on by the positively charged nuclei of atoms. These pulling forces hold the atoms together. This arrangement is known as a single bond.
- The molecules with single bonds are less reactive unlike the molecules with multiple bonds. Moreover, they are weaker than multiple bonds and have higher bond lengths due to the low pulling force between atoms when compared to multiple bonds.
- It has 1 [[Sigma Bonds|sigma bond]]
- A single bond is denoted by just a single dash
-  Examples 
	-  C - C.Â  Alkanes such as methane, ethane, propane are some examples for compounds with single bonds
