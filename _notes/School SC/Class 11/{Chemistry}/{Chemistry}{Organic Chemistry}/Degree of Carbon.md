- **[[Degree of Carbon]] is the number of carbon atoms directly attaches with the carbon taken into consideration**
>[!imp]
>[[Degree of Hydrogen]] is the same degree of the carbon atom that the hydrogen is attached to
- Number of hydrogens attached to the carbon is inversely proportional to the [[Degree of Carbon]]  .
- 0$\degree$<[[Degree of Carbon]] < 5$\degree$ 
	- The possible degrees of carbon are 1$\degree$ , 2$\degree$ , 3$\degree$ , 4$\degree$ 
		- 1$\degree$ --> CH$_{3}$ 
		- 2$\degree$ --> CH$_{2}$ 
		- 3$\degree$ --> CH 
		- 4$\degree$ --> C
