# Nomenclature of Organic Compounds
- In general, an IUPAC name will have three essential features:
	•  A root or base indicating a major chain or ring of carbon atoms found in the molecular structure.  
	•  A suffix or other element(s) designating [[Functional Groups|functional groups]] that may be present in the compound.  
	•  Names of [[Substituent Groups|substituent groups]], other than hydrogen, that complete the molecular structure.

## Without Functional Groups 
- [[Organic Compounds]] that have no [[Functional Groups]]  are made up of only **carbons** and **hydrogens** which are bonded together by [[Sigma Bonds]] ($\sigma$).
- All carbons are sp$^3$ hybridized since the number of [[Sigma Bonds]] are **3**
- [[Hydrocarbons]] having no double or triple bond functional groups are classified as [[Alkanes|alkanes]] or [[Cycloalkanes|cycloalkanes]], depending on whether the carbon atoms of the molecule are arranged only in chains or also in rings. Although these hydrocarbons have no functional groups, they constitute the framework on which [[Functional Groups]] are located in other classes of compounds, and provide an ideal starting point for studying and naming organic compounds. The [[Alkanes|alkanes]] and [[Cycloalkanes|cycloalkanes]] are also members of a larger class of compounds referred to as [[Aliphatic|aliphatic]]. Simply put, [[Aliphatic|aliphatic]] compounds are compounds that do not incorporate any [[Aromatic Compounds|Aromatic Rings]] in their molecular structure
