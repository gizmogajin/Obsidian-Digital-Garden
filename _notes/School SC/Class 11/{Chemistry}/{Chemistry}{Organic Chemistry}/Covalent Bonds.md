- [[Bonds]] formed as the result of sharing of electrons between atoms are called [[Covalent Bonds]] .
- Covalent bonds are much weaker than the [[Ionic Bond|ionic bonds]] and, therefore, most of the covalent compounds exist in the **gaseous phase**.
- The atoms need to form bonds in order to attain a [[Stable Electronic Configuration|stable electronic configuration]]. The third way of obtaining this (apart from **donating** and **receiving** electrons as in the case of the ionic bonds) is through the **sharing of electrons**.
- **It is important that the atoms come into close proximity of each other for the [[Orbital]] overlap before the electron sharing takes place**
- Shared electrons generally stays in the middle of the nuclei of sharing atoms.
	- ie, [[Covalent Bonds]] are electrically neutral
	- ***However, [[Fractional Charge]] can be formed in [[Polar Covalent Bond]] due to [[Dipole moment]] resulting in [[Polarization]]***
- Overlapping of [[Orbital]]s can take place in linear fashion or in a parallel manner
- Types
	- Based on Overlapping
		- [[Sigma Bonds]]
		- [[Pi Bonds]]
	- Based on the number of bonds
		- [[Single Bonds]] 
		- [[Double bonds]] 
		- [[Triple bonds]] 
	- [[Reactivity]]
		- [[Triple bonds]]  > [[Double bonds]]  > [[Single Bonds]] 
	- [[Bond Strength]]
		- [[Triple bonds]]  > [[Double bonds]]  > [[Single Bonds]] 
	- [[Pulling Force]]
		- [[Triple bonds]]  > [[Double bonds]]  > [[Single Bonds]] 
	- [[Bond Length]]
		- [[Single Bonds]] > [[Double bonds]] > [[Triple bonds]]
