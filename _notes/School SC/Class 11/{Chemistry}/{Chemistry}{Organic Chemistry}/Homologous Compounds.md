- [[Compounds]] having
	- **same [[Family]]**
	- **same general formula**
	- **same [[Functional Groups]] **
	- **different [[Molecular Formula]] **
	- **different [[Molecular Weight]] **
	- **differ in CH$_{2}$ units**
- Series of [[Homologous Compounds]] are called [[Homologous Compounds|Homologous Series]].
	- they have a [[Common Difference]] of CH$_{2}$ 
- Example
